      <h3>MyApp</h3>
      <p>
        I developed a mobile blog app where authenticated users can log in securely, then create, edit, and delete posts
        in
        real time. Firebase provides seamless authentication and cloud data storage, ensuring that updates sync
        instantly across all devices. Cordova allowed me to package the app for Android.
